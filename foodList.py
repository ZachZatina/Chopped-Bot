#able to concatenate tuples but maybe do dictionary pairs so that its easier to tell when something is a meat so you dont get mulptiple meats?
#will have to look into more when actually parsing and getting ingredients from lists/tuples the proper way to add lists together.
#TODO: add function that gets the "season" for food and grabs the corresponding list for said season for that specific food.
